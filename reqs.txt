    cannot capture while home flag is away
    exploit detection and prevention (speed-hacking, teleporting, aim-botting, instant-kill, wall-hacking, RAT-ing)

    GDPR (imagining we're holding a crap-ton of personally identifing information for this)

    Tgt is IPAddress:Port
    Using Sockets API (Berkeley Sockets API, I/O interface)
